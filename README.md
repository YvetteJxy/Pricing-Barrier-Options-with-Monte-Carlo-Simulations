# Pricing-Barrier-Options-with-Monte-Carlo-Simulations
## The tasks listed as below:

1) Replicate the same numerical experiments as the examples for pricing the
barrier option in class.

2) Price European call option with its strike (reasonably) depending on your
student ID using Monte Carlo simulation, and then compare with the result
from the analytic B-S formula. This procedure is the so-called "benchmarking".
Analyze the numerical errors caused by the time discretization.

3) Price this barrier option by the local volatility model with its volatility
function (reasonably) depending on your student ID and Heston stochastic
volatility model using Monte Carlo simulation by the time discretization. For
each model, plot one sample path which hits the barrier and one path that
never hits the barrier.

4) Price discrete-monitored barrier options (e.g. at the closing of the last
day of each month or each day), and compare with the price under the
continuous-time version. Analyze how the price changes with respect to the
number of discrete-monitored barriers.

5) Self-study and price China’s snowball option (雪球期权) based on what you
learned from our course, and provide at least one numerical example.
